# Project-1
🚀 Excited to share my first data analysis project using Power BI! 🎉

I've created an interactive dashboard showcasing key performance indicators (KPIs) that provide valuable insights into booking data. Here are the KPIs included:

1. 📊 *Total Bookings*: Track the overall number of bookings made.
2. 💰 *Total Revenue*: Monitor the total revenue generated.
3. ⭐ *Average Rating*: Analyze the average customer rating.
4. 🏢 *Total Capacity*: Check the total capacity available.
5. 📈 *Total Successful Bookings*: Count the bookings that were successfully completed.
6. 📉 *Occupancy %*: Measure the occupancy rate as a percentage.
7. ❌ *Total Cancelled Bookings*: Keep an eye on the number of bookings that were cancelled.
8. 🚫 *Cancellation Rate*: Calculate the rate of cancellations.
9. 💸 *Revenue Loss*: Determine the revenue lost due to cancellations.
10. 🛏 *Total Stay*: Sum up the total number of stay days.

Power BI has enabled me to visualize data in a meaningful way, uncover trends, and make data-driven decisions. Looking forward to diving deeper into data analysis and sharing more insights!
